## 🚀 What is Euphoria?

**Euphoria** transforms cryptocurrency trading into an intuitive, fast-paced prediction game. Instead of complex charts and order books, you simply predict where Solana's price will go—**up or down**—on a visual grid that scrolls in real-time.

> 🎯 **Place your bet. Watch the price. Collect your wins.**

This isn't your grandfather's trading terminal. This is trading reimagined for the next generation.
